"Stomp"
Guide on building your first HID USB Device
A Foot-pedal stomp keyboard
est: 1 weekend

Reasons
--------

Back in 2013-01, I sat down for a few hours reading about interfacing
with USB devices on Linux. My goal was to write bindings for the <a href="http://www.stealthswitch.com/">StealthSwitch</a>
foot petal keyboard so I could use it (my feet) to control my window
manager, <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/">stumpwm</a>. Stumpwm is a tiling window manager with similar keybindings
to GNU Screen which runs on and can be programmed through lisp (clisp or sbcl).
For those interested in trying and or configuring stumpwm, I suggest
referring to <a href="http://www.mygooglest.com/fni/stumpwm.html">mygoolest</a> and <a href="http://www.xsteve.at/prg/stumpwm/">xsteve</a>.

Anyway, the problem is, the StealthSwitch relied on crazy windows
special keys and the the chip was permenantly flashed (probably
because it is cheaper) preventing us from making this a practical
solution. So, I decided to implement from scratch.

Requirements
------------

This assumes you will be using a Linux based system with the aptitude
package manager.

0) Understanding USB

The take-home message (what USB does) is at 7:36. The reason there are
2 wires (other than ground and vcc) differential signaling

1) Acquire Hardware
- <a href="http://www.cutedigi.com/breakout-board/ezusb-cy7c68014a-usb-2-0-development-board.html">EZ-USB&reg; Cypress FX2LP CY7C68014A board</a> (8051 intel core, 8 bit w/ 16bit addressing) for ~$50* <a href="http://www.cypress.com/?docID=48811">(spec)</a>
- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TRENDnet-USB-RS-232-Serial-Converter/dp/B0007T27H8">Serial to USB converter<a/> if your computer doesn't have serial (for debugging)

*If you're on a tight budget, you can buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/EZ-USB-CY7C68013A-Development-Analyzer-EEPROM/dp/B009NR8ZY4">CY7C68013A</a>
for $10, but it will not have serial (debugging must be done with USB,
which requires requires the device to respond with a correct
descriptor + it's limited + weird).

2) Download <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/">SDCC</a>, the Small Device C Compiler

    $ sudo apt-get install sdcc

3) Acquire FX2 Library routines from <a href="https://github.com/djmuhlestein/fx2lib">https://github.com/djmuhlestein/fx2lib</a>.
- Fx2lib essentially provides macros and variable bindings for the Cypress FX2 registers via SDCC.

    # Install + Load
    $ git clone https://github.com/djmuhlestein/fx2lib.git
    $ cd fx2lib/examples/bulkloop
    $ make #compile
    $ cycfx2prog #load
    Using ID XXXX:XXXX on XXX.XXX. 
    
    # Run the example/demo:
    $ sudo cycfx2prog prg:build/bulkloop.ihx run

4) Start with using the fx2lib <a href="https://github.com/djmuhlestein/fx2lib/tree/master/examples/bulkloop">"bulkloop" example</a>.

5) Implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class">HID</a> (Human Interface Device Device Class) USB class device descriptors 
- Modify the bulkloop project's Intel 8051 (MCS-51) assembly descriptor file, <a href="https://github.com/djmuhlestein/fx2lib/blob/master/examples/bulkloop/dscr.a51">dscr.a51</a>, to correctly identify device as HID[<a href="http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/HID1_11.pdf">1</a>].


Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (HID), Firmware Specificationâ€”6/27/01 Version 1.11 

6) Compile + Use cycfx2prog or fxload to load your compiled SDCC code onto the FX2

    $ sudo apt-get install cycfx2prog fxload

7) Verified (6) using:

    $ lsusb -v

8) Implement the corresponding logic for each promise we made in (a) to the kernel, as required by your ideas.

9) Debugging: Re-run step (6) and then test your device using GNU Screen 

    Installation:
    $ sudo apt-get install screen

    Connecting to device (using serial):
    # Assuming you're using serial to USB
    $ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 57600

    # Assuming you're using vanilla serial
    $ screen /dev/ttyS0 57600

10) Develop client applications + Share your code
- In our case, the reason for making a USB HID is we are developing an emacs food-pedal called STOMP to.

Notes
-----

- Add a function to the code, bulkload.c:
add a case toBOOL handle_vendorcommand(BYTE cmd) {

import usb1;con = usb1.USBContext();beard = con.openByVendorIDAndProductID(0x04b4, 0x1004);beard.controlWrite(0x40, 0xb2, 0, 0, b'')
