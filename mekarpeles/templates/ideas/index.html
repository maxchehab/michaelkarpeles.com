    A web framework for static documents which provides links to all
    different versions of the resource and visually shows diffs of the
    content. By default only the latest changes (from the last commit)
    will be highlighted in (minimally distracing)
    color/highlight. Clicking on a previous revision will show the
    document at that time, with colored elements representing the most
    recent commit to that version of the document.
