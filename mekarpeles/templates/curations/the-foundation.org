Rebooting Society from Ground Up
* The Foundation
As human beings, our capabilities are limited by three factors: access
to or possession of resources, information describing these resources,
and the intelligence or mental faculties to use together these
things. Theses three components thus define the boundaries of our
freedom. The objective of this work is to discern low hanging fruit
for affording people freedom in each of these three areas. Towards a
resource which describes the necessity and procurement of raw
materials, and how to build the simplest effectie forms of the
world's most impactful technologies, such as paper, metallurgy and
wire, magnets, electric generators, batteries, plastic, and glass. The
importance of each of these components will be justified and each of
their dependencies on other inventions will be recursively
specified. The result of this work is a curriculum of co-dependent
instructions, information, and resources for implementing from
raw/naturally found materials the most significant technical
achievements of humanity.

*** DONE [[Mine Sulfur (S)]]
Extreme Caution! Mining sulfur is often accompanied by the release of
[[Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)]] in gas form, which is toxic, and the release of
[[Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)]], which is so toxic, very short exposure could cause
death. See: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UBk8f7Bgj0][BBC Documentary]].

1. Sulfur (S) deposits are found naturally in areas
around hot springs and in volcanic regions. It is also widely found in
nature as iron pyrites (iron sulfide), galena (lead sulfide), gypsum
(calcium sulfate), Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) and many other
minerals.

*** DONE [[Mine Bauxite]]
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauxite][Bauxite's Composition]] is gibbsite Al(OH)3, boehmite γ-AlO(OH) and
diaspore α-AlO(OH), mixed with the two iron oxides goethite and
haematite, the clay mineral kaolinite and small amounts of anatase
TiO2. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauxite#Production_trends][Locating Bauxite]] Can be found in Arkansas

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaSwimvCGA8][Aluminium Extraction]] Holyhead Wales, UK [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa6KEwWY9HU][How it's made]] - it comes from
bauxite (in tropical countries) aluminium bonded to oxygen. Bonds
broken by electrolosis.

Location: Jordan

1. [[http://www.copper.org/education/Kids/copperandkids_wheredoescopper.html][Locating Copper Ore]]: The largest copper mine is found in Utah
   (Bingham Canyon). Other major mines are found in Arizona, Michigan,
   New Mexico and Montana. In South America, Chile, the world's

*** DONE [[Extract Woodland Ant Acid]]
Formic acid was first extracted in 1671 by the English naturalist John
Ray by distilling a large number of crushed ants of this species
(Charles Earle Raven (1986). John Ray, naturalist : his life and
works. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-31083-0.)
[[http://www.henriettes-herb.com/eclectic/kings/acidum-form.html][The process is described here]].

Alternately, you can get a some sort of absorbant material and
aggitate the ants, forcing them to spit the formic acid on the
material and then later extract the solution from the material by
applying pressure / squeezing.

*** DONE [[Gather Barley]]
Or any of several cereal plants (e.g. barley, oats, rice, rye and
wheat) Because barley is such a highly adapted cereal grain it can be
grown in climates that range from sub-Arctic to subtropical. The
European Union-27 is the largest barley producer followed by Russia
and Ukraine. The U.S. is recognized as the world's seventh largest
barley producer. (http://www.barleyfoods.org/facts.html)

The obective is to produce a slab or billet shaped [[Iron (Fe)]]

**** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noGGcyPHtdI][Instructions]]
1. Calculate the desired magnet strength in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)][Tesla units]] (a
   refrigerator magnet is ~5mT)
2. A [[Steel ()]] rod
3. An [[Inductor]] consisting of [[Copper (Cu)]] [[Insulated Wire]] coiled around
   the [[Steel ()]] core [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrite_core][Ferrite Core]].
4. A [[Battery]] capable of 12V, 200A

*** Inductor
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgwXkUt3XxQ][Inductor basics - What is an inductor?]] A passive analog component
which temporarily generates a magnetic field (e.g. electromagnets)
from electrical energy. Depending on the [[Core]] material (e.g. if it
is steel) it may be turned into a permenant magnet. Otherwise, while
there is current through the inductor, the [[Core]] will behave as an
temporary electromagnet.

1. Create [[Copper (Cu)]] [[Insulated Wire]] whose length and thickness is determined by
   [[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/indsol.html][Calculating inductance of solenoid]].
2. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDIWNHOoNh8][Coil]] [[Insulated Wire]] around a [[Slab]] shaped [[Steel ()]] [[Core]] according to
   [[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/indsol.html][Calculating inductance of solenoid]].

*** Insulate Wire
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electricity)#Insulation_in_electrical_apparatus][In production]], "electrical wires [are] insulated with polyethylene,
crosslinked polyethylene (either through electron beam processing or
chemical crosslinking), PVC, Kapton, rubber-like polymers, oil
impregnated paper, Teflon, silicone, or modified ethylene
tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE). Larger power cables may use compressed
inorganic powder, depending on the application".

This process can be substituted with thermoplastics or rubber. This
may include polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinylchloride (PVC),
Polyvinylidene Chloride (PVDC), polystyrene,
polyethylenetheraphthalate and polycarbonate. Note: chloride degrades
from electricity, not a great candidate for wire insulation. These
options are complex to make, invovle carcinogen, and require
catalysts. If you did have some something like polyvinyl chloride
(saran wrap) you could follow [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKOe_FfiDuk][this tutorial]]. Otherwise, the best
approach, in the wild, is using natural rubber:

**** Steps
1. Produce a [[Wire]] from the desired material.
2. Between [[Natural Rubber]] steps 2 and 3, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpu5mH5me1Y&feature=youtu.be&t=1m40s][Coat]] wire with partially
   coagulated [[Polyisoprene (C5H8)]]
3. [[https://youtu.be/sDIWNHOoNh8?t=5m4s][Tin]] the leads (ends) of the [[Insulated Wire]] using [[Rubber-sandpaper]]

1. Follow [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILQ6UF1ELRQ][Homemade Bricks]] to locate 7 parts sand [[Silicon Dioxide (SiO2)]]
2. Follow [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILQ6UF1ELRQ][Homemade Bricks]] to locate 1 part [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay][Clay]].
3. Add 2 parts Water [[Hydrogen Dioxide (H2O)]]
3. Add [[Straw]] as a binding substitute in place of cement.


** Experimental
*** Electroplating / Galvenizing 
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jimPImGKPy8][How to galvanize metal (for rust protection)]]
**** TODO Thermite (Explosive)
Explosives were considered as a mechanism for mining. This recipe is
fairly unfeasible given it requires electrolysis of bauxite

1. 22.5g of [[Silicon Dioxide]] (9 parts)
2. 25g of [[Aluminium (Al)]] powder, 425 [[http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/chemistry/stockroom-reagents/learning-center/technical-library/particle-size-conversion.html][mesh]] (~.025mm - .03mm) (10 parts)
3. 30g of [[Sulfur (S)]] "Q682" powder (12 parts


**** Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)
At standard atmosphere, it is a toxic gas with a pungent, irritating,
and rotten smell.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide

**** Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)
Toxic, very short exposure could cause death.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide

**** TODO Steel
Reduce Iron Oxide Mix with carbon rich coal (coke) and limestone

***** Industrial Production
Industrially, magnets are composed of a smelted blend of the following elements:
[[Copper (Cu)]], [[Cobalt (Co)]], [[Nickel (Ni)]], [[Sulfur (S) "Q682"]], [[Iron (Fe)]], [[aluminium (Al)]], [[titanium (Ti)]]

**** TODO Zinc
Zinc is useful for galvenizing or electroplating iron, a process by
which iron or other metals may be treated to prevent rusting.
