"[activity in the] prefrontal cortex increases when people lie. The prefrontal cortex,
situated just behind the forehead, is a collection of regions
responsible for executive control (the ability to regulate thoughts or
actions to achieve goals). Executive control includes cognitive
processes such as planning, problem solving, and attention — all
important components of deception — so it’s no surprise the prefrontal
cortex is active when we lie. Dishonesty requires the brain to work
harder than honesty, and this effort is reflected by increased brain
activity. Studies even show people take longer to respond when lying."

"Even without a clear ‘lying’ region, researchers can use fMRI to
detect when a study participant is telling a lie in the laboratory
with about 85 percent accuracy (polygraph tests, which measure changes
in blood pressure, skin conductivity, and respiration during
questioning, produce similar accuracy in the laboratory setting).
</p>
<p>
How closely do laboratory paradigms model real-world lies? Not very
closely, says Stanford University’s Anthony Wagner, who studies memory
and has testified in court against the validity of fMRI lie
detection. As Wagner explains, laboratory studies involve instruction
to tell a low-stakes lie about an action they recently
performed. However, in the real world, lies are self-generated, often
high risk and emotionally charged, and lie detection may occur years
after the event in question.
</p>
<p>
Another issue that has not been adequately studied, Wagner says, is
how countermeasures, such as small movements, changes in breathing, or
altered cognitive processing, can affect the accuracy of fMRI lie
detection. By using countermeasures, a person may be able to
deliberately offset any brain changes associated with deception to
defeat lie detection technology. A recent study found the accuracy of
fMRI for lie detection dropped to a mere 33 percent when participants
used countermeasures during questioning."

"Matthew Lieberman's research suggests that high intelligence often
corresponds with low self-awareness. The neural networks involved in
information holding, planning, and cognitive problem solving reside in
the lateral, or outer, portions of the brain, whereas the middle
regions support self-awareness, social skills, and empathy. These
regions are inversely correlated. As Lieberman notes, 'If you spend a
lot of time in cognitive tasks, your ability to have empathy for
people is reduced simply because that part of your circuitry doesn't
get much use.'" (page 10)

"The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala">amygdala</a>, an almond-shaped set of neurons deep in the temporal
lobe, has emerged as a key region in bias research. It is the part of
the brain that reacts to fear and threat. Scientists have found a
correlation between amygdala activity and implicit racial bias."
</p>
<p>
Amodio and his colleagues also have found implicit stereotyping
associated with the left temporal and frontal lobes. The left temporal
lobe is important for storing general information about people and
objects, and Amodio said this seems to be an important place for
social stereotypes. The medial frontal cortex is important for forming
impressions of others, empathy and various forms of reasoning.
</p>
<p>
And a 2012 study by Columbia University psychologists G. Elliott
Wimmer and Daphna Shohamy found that the hippocampus, which forms
links between memories such as dates and facts, also subconsciously
steers people toward choosing one option over another
</p>
<p>
Amodio’s research has found that the brain is well-equipped for
controlling unwanted biases — if the person detects their presence.
</p>
<p>
The anterior cingulate cortex, which plays an important role in
cognitive control, can detect the activation of implicit
attitudes. This region appears to detect conflicts between a person’s
overarching goal — such as being egalitarian — and automatic behaviors
that conflict with it — such as prejudiced thoughts or intentions.
</p>
<p>
The anterior cingulate then signals the dorsolateral frontal cortex,
which is involved in making moral decisions, creating the possibility
of overriding implicit biases."

"Uncertainty registers (in a part of the brain called the anterior
cigulate cortex) as an error, gap, or tension: something that must be
corrected before one can feel comfortable again. This is why people
crave certainty. [&hellip;] Mild uncertainty attracts interest and
attention: New and challenging situations create a mild threat
response, increasing levels of adrenalin and dopamine just enough to
spark curiosity and energize people to solve problems." (page 6)
</p>
<p>
Uncertainty is a complex spectrum which depends both on one's neural
thresholds, experience and preference, and the nature of the
uncertainty). In terms of experience in preference, people may have
differe sentiments towards outcomes, i.e. whether one sees them as
good or bad. One might be relieved to learn of the availability of an
injection which can cure their illness while another may be upset by
the prospects of an injection. There are other confounding factors,
such as the probability associated with the uncertainty (which relates
to our neural thresholds; how likely an event is to trigger a
response). And, should the event occur, what is the severity and
permenance of the outcome? For instance, I might be killed at any
moment, but I don't worry about many of these possibilities I find
determine their probability too low to merit concern.
</p>
<p>
In the case of uncertainty attracting interest, perhaps the reasoning
is that one sees the possibility of reward as sufficiently greater
than the risk that it outweighs the fact that risks are weighted more
heavily than rewards (according to David Rock, et al), or that the
risk is nominal (e.g. not life threatening). Or, that ignoring the
event will pose bigger risk. Another component yet perhaps is whether
there are things we can do (autonomy, control) to affect the
outcome. This relates to "The Autonomy Factor" in David Rock's
article.
</p>
<p>
These factors can probably be distilled into a relatively accurate SVM
(support vector machine) classifier to approximate/determine ideal
level of uncertainty for various populations under different
constraints. [see 4 below]
</p>
<p>
"Sharing business plans, rationales for change, and accurate maps of
an organization's structure propotes [a perception of certainty to
build confident and dedicated tems]. Transparent practices are the
foundation on which the perception of certainty rests" (page 7)

"Once people make a stronger social connection, their brains begin to
secrete a hormone called oxytocin in on another's presence. This
chemical which has been linked with affection, maternal behavior,
sexual arousal, and generosity, disarms the threat response and
further activates the neural networks that permit us to perceive
someone as 'just like [acceptable to] us'. Research by Michael Kosfeld
et al. in 2005 shows that a shot of oxytocin delivered by means of a
nasal spray decreases threat arousal." (page 8)
