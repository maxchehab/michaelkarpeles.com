<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Life Learnings &amp; Agreeable Principles </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<ul>
<li>
Protocols are Key. Implementing a patch or shim simply means there
is resistence to protocol. (rule of thumb: protocols are constant or
linear, shims are quadratic in implementation)
</li>
<li>
It's easy to get a no, if you want a yes, first achieve a related
accomplishment which one would be irresponsible to turn down.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</li>
<li>
Systems should be designed which give users the power of choice, not the service provider.
</li>
<li>
Effective procrastination is key &ndash; taking breaks and shifting
contexts is important, but if you differentiate between work and
play, something is wrong.
</li>
<li>
Recaputlate and re-integrate often
</li>
<li>
Life favors the prepared (paraphrasing Louis Pasteur @Q529) and "it
is hard for an empty sack to stand upright" (Franklin)
</li>
<li>
Have multiple projects you've thought about, even if you can't work
on them all. Think about who can work on them.
</li>
<li>
maintain a list of `n` people who are worth supporting / helping /
investing in<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</li>
<li>
A closed mouth doesn't get fed, ask for help when you need it.
</li>
<li>
We are naturally coerced to act like those around us. Either by
necessity of a competitive spirit, to achieve higher status, or out
of desire to accommodate/oblige those around us."<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</li>
<li>
Encourage your friends to partner with you. Commit to aplifying your
combined efforts on areas you are mutually passionate. Do not get
greedy; consider your combined accountability and contributions
should more than double your individual effectiveness.
</li>
<li>
publishing your belief, early, on an topic is a good way to figure
out if you're wrong and who cares about the issue being right.
</li>
<li>
Before you complain about equity in a project, figure out if you
would be doing a project even if your partners weren't
</li>
<li>
80/20 engineering may be good enough to create something valuable
and working, but remember the remaining 20% often includes a
strategy for adoption
</li>
<li>
"Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling
conversation"<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>
</li>
<li>
Be honest, but know what to say, what not, how and when to say
it. In the words of Franklin, "Tricks and treachery are the practice
of fools, that don't have brains enough to be honest."
</li>
<li>
Freedom of speech can be equally as important as freedom from the thoughts of others.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</li>
<li>
Avoid sarcasm unless it can be employed as method of non-hurtful
social encryption. The following is an except from <sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.5" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>: McGraw and
Caleb Warren, a doctoral student, presented their elegantly simple
formulation in the August 2010 issue of the journal Psychological
Science. Their paper, “Benign Violations: Making Immoral Behavior
Funny,” cited scores of philosophers, psychologists, and
neuroscientists (as well as Mel Brooks and Carol Burnett). The
theory they lay out: “Laughter and amusement result from violations
that are simultaneously seen as benign.” That is, they perceive a
violation—”of personal dignity (e.g., slapstick, physical
deformities), linguistic norms (e.g., unusual accents,
malapropisms), social norms (e.g., eating from a sterile bedpan,
strange behaviors), and even moral norms (e.g., bestiality,
disrespectful behaviors)”—while simultaneously recognizing that the
violation doesn’t pose a threat to them or their worldview. The
theory is ludicrously, vaporously simple. But extensive field tests
revealed nuances, variables that determined exactly how funny a joke
was perceived to be.

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> 1% Optimizations (Organization: Storage &amp; Retrieval) </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<ol>
<li>
Require everything have a place. You'll spend less time searching
for your phone, wallet or purse. If things aren't required to have
a place, verifying tasks (involving many items) are complete can
explode combinatorially. The same is especially true for
thoughts. We have a lot of them, so keeping them organized is
important, otherwise, some computation becomes intractable. In the
words of Benjamin Franklin, "Let all your things have their
place"<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.4.2" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>
</li>
<li>
When you're loading a dishwasher, place all similar cuttlery
together. It's a constant time insertion whether your insert a
utensil in the correct or an arbitrary bucket (the bucketing is
basically a hash, which means a marginal scalar factor added to the
expense of insertion), but if you front-load this computation, the
sort operation at retrieval time will be a constant, versus a
linear sort. Then the limiting factor becomes the size/bandwidth of
your hand. That's a problem for someone else to solve.
</li>
<li>
Put your socks, underwear, and shirts in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Laundry-Zipped-Washing-Underwear-Storage/dp/B013I3CEEK">separate mesh nets</a> when
washing and drying to reduce time separating your items.
</li>
<li>
Buy all of the same white socks to further reduce sorting complexity.
</li>
<li>
If you want to perform an activity more, make the items it entails
spatially and temporally local. For instance, to practice guitar
more, leave the instrument out of its case and in your way. The
same is true of documents or tabs in your browser. The same is true
for negative influences; reduce their spatial and local presence.

<ul>
<li>
Have concrete, concise and well reasoned answers, be willing to
change them. Premeditate answers, ponder their context and
significance, and do so on your own time. Life favors the prepared
(paraphrasing Louis Pasteur @Q529). To understand and be capable of
articulating your stance is a competitive advantage and will help
you identify others who align.
</li>
<li>
If someone asks you for your biggest life learning, you should have
some pre-meditated answer
</li>
<li>
If someone asks you for your favorite philosopher, you should have
some pre-meditated answer. A philosopher is simply one who is
passionate about something. Who cares about something, thinks about
something, and develops conventions and methodologies to address
this something. The only reason not to have a favourite is because
you haven't found a "something" you care enough about that you're
willing to learn from others.

If someone asks you your life mission, or what you stand for, you
should have some pre-meditated answer
