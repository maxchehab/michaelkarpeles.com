One small step (concept) towards informing our US voting system:
problem: A significant inefficiency in the political arena is caused by requiring voters to compress the dimensionality of their entire belief system into a logistic classification of a single candidate. To exacerbate the problem, these voters' decisions are typically motivated (read: swayed) by the candidates' "pitch" and appeal, rather than empirical evidence of candidates' voting history on bills and the likes.
solution: One solution to address this problem is a n (=10? needs to be A/B tested) question poll (possibly allow user to answer more, if desired) which presents the potential voter with questions relevant to their political stance/interests (on economics, education, military, human rights). Simple user-item filtering is done to surface the candidates which empirically best align with your beliefs.
challenges: A candidate may align well with your beliefs but be sleazy/unethical (have irreconcilable differences which need to be addressed by the system) . People may feel disproportionately strong towards certain (deal-breaker) policies. And more problems. And more problems. The intent of the concept is to aim for 80/20 and increase the impact of each vote (perhaps achieve more votes / representation).
Implementation:
1. Build postgres sparse matrix of candidates and their voting history
data available in bulk here: https://www.govtrack.us/developers/data
2. Supervised/community/domain-expert labeling/classifying of each "bill" (most expensive step time-wise)
3. Simple algorithm (possibly a summed-weighted avg) to determine best candidate based on voters' (online-learning on trained profile, or anonymous 1-time answers to) questionnaire
4. Basic website using python flask, RoR, node.js or some equivalent web-stack.
Optimistic Next Steps:
* Using bitcoin protocol to allow people to vote/publish (even if it's not an official system) using these recommendations.
Other Attempts (aka, it's not original/novel):
This was attempted once before by ElectNext aka VersaHQ (https://versahq.com (defunct)) which went and got acquired by Change.org.
