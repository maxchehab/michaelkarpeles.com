Abstract

The idea of implementing org-mode (as a rending environment) as
opposed to html and allowing web "resources" to execute each other as
modules. I am imagining a "living" (interactive, evolving), connected
web ecosystem for literate, reproducible research/programming which
allows native programmatic interop/intercommunication between
resources, modular and reusable components.

For example, imagine being in a (webpage) resource and clicking a
block to execute its underlying routine / dependencies (run within the
rcontext of your client or perhaps the resource optoinally
provides/points to a VM for this purpose). Trying an alternative
approach to an existing "research paper" could be as simple as forking
or linking to their "resource" (perhaps each resource has a git repo
associated with it at some special endpoint determined by an RFC) and
inheriting the programmatic qualities of their org-mode document for
free.

The easiest solution (which would be helpful all to... maybe 100
people) is an emacs org-browser mode (which uses org-mode but allows
navigation of or between networked org-mode documents) and uses the
native OS as the environment (as opposed to browser client) for
computation (which makes more sense).  The whole thing is fuzzy and
just proof of concept, not genuinely a recommendation of a specific
implementation.

The first step is to follow in the footprints of Bashky et al. in
"EXPOSURE TO IDEOLOGICALLY DIVERSE NEWS AND OPINION ON FACEBOOK" by
organizing, maintaining, and releasing all the components and
resources used to reproducibly achieve their results.

The next step towards achieving reproducible research is by providing
a different compiler than LaTeX and requiring minimal change to
author's existing flow and markup process. Authors should remain
researches and not spend the majority of their time formatting.

I think the way this can be made mainstream (steppable, reproducible,
and interactive research) while not causing additional work to the
authors, would be to provide some sort of replacement compiler to
LaTeX which is able to generate both a static paper as well as a rich
step-through-able web page which can be executed sequentially and
piece wise (like mathematica) using a backend like http://sandstorm.io
or http://terminal.io. Of course the paper could also have interactive
graphics, similar to the one included in thumbnail, which can be
generated using default d3-like templates (without requiring
programming/markup beyond what is already required for LaTeX.

Ahmed El-Hassany This idea reminds me of the work of Richard Taylor's
group at UC Irvine: here is one paper and you can easily track the
others on their website
