Abstract

The idea of implementing org-mode (as a rending environment) as
opposed to html and allowing web "resources" to execute each other as
modules. I am imagining a "living" (interactive, evolving), connected
web ecosystem for literate, reproducible research/programming which
allows native programmatic interop/intercommunication between
resources, modular and reusable components.

For example, imagine being in a (webpage) resource and clicking a
block to execute its underlying routine / dependencies (run within the
context of your client or perhaps the resource optoinally
provides/points to a VM for this purpose). Trying an alternative
approach to an existing "research paper" could be as simple as forking
or linking to their "resource" (perhaps each resource has a git repo
associated with it at some special endpoint determined by an RFC) and
inheriting the programmatic qualities of their org-mode document for
free.

The easiest solution (which would be helpful all to... maybe 100
people) is an emacs org-browser mode (which uses org-mode but allows
navigation of or between networked org-mode documents) and uses the
native OS as the environment (as opposed to browser client) for
computation (which makes more sense).  The whole thing is fuzzy and
just proof of concept, not genuinely a recommendation of a specific
implementation.


Ahmed El-Hassany This idea reminds me of the work of Richard Taylor's
group at UC Irvine: here is one paper and you can easily track the
others on their website
