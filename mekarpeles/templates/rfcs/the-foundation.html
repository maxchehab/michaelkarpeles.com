Building a Curriculum for Life

Abstract

As human beings, our capabilities are limited by three things: access
to or posession of resources, information describing these resources,
and the mental facilities to use together these things. Theses three
components thus define the boundaries of our freedom. The objective of
this work is to discern low hanging fruit for affording people freedom
in each of these three areas. Towards a resource which describes the
necessity and procurement of raw materials, and how to build the
simplest effective forms of the world's most impactful technologies,
such as paper, metallurgy and wire, magnets, electric generators,
batteries, plastic, and glass. The importance of each of these
components will be justified and each of their dependencies on other
inventions will be recursively specified. The result of this work is a
curriculum of co-dependent instructions, information, and resources
for implementing from raw/naturally found materials the most
significant technical achievements of humanity. 

Inspiration
This concept is loosely based on The Foundation Series
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series), a science fiction
series by Isaac Asimov.
