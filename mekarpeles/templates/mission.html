<h2><a name="intro">Intro</a></h2>

<p>
  Curating a living map of the world's knowledge means contributing
  towards systems which make humanity more effective at pursuing
  answers to meaningful questions. It also necessitates that humanity
  should have tools to obtain a more holistic understanding of the
  questions we're asking (and the implications surrounding these
  questions and answers). It is inspired by Vannevar
  Bush's <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881">Memex</a>
  and Tim
  Berners-Lee's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Global_Graph">Giant
  Global Graph</a>.
</p>

<p>
  A big part of this mission involves structuring and connecting
  related data in relevant ways. It also entails designing Artificial
  Intelligence algorithms capable of classifying data with (or
  without) varying levels of human assistance. Above all, it means
  building views and interfaces (i.e. maps) which enable people both
  to easily contribute knowledge (e.g. Wikipedia) and explore fields of
  knowledge.
</p>

<p>Here is why I choose the words I did:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong><a name="curate">Curate</a></strong> - There are millions
    of people creating new works without taking responsibility to
    adequately consider, research, and connect what exists. Instead of
    a one time investment by we the individuals, we often publish
    loosely and require that every reader repeat the same work of
    sifting through an increasingly unmanageable endless stream of
    redundant information. What's worse is this information is often
    unstructured and challenging to deduplicate. Having a lot of data,
    examples, and ideas is a great thing, so long as it doesn't
    overwhelm our ability to reason about them or lead to
    inconsistencies or ireconsilable differences. Consolidating,
    re-integrating, repurposing and polishing existing works is a
    great way to improve the value of a fields knowledge.
    (Recommended further
    reading: <a href="http://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/">Research
    Debt</a>. i.e. why learning is so hard and the low hanging fruit
    we're missing to fix this).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><a name="living">Living</a></strong> - The universe is
    always changing. And as it does, there will paradoxically always
    be variables we cannot measure. Either because they are too far in
    the past, too distant in the present, or because they have yet to
    happen. re: Godel's incompleteness theorem and John McCarthy's
    Frame Problem, if a single equation of the world exists, we would
    only be able to heuristically approximate it with some high
    acuracy, never to prove it. One is unable to prove a system from
    within it because a proof of verification would paradoxically
    require keeping track of all the state of the system which by
    definition would require more bits than are in the system. Thus,
    we should always be adapting and revising our understanding
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><a name="map">Map</a></strong> - It's important that my
    life goal entails a map, rather than a graph. A map implies a goal
    of discovery and a cartography. A way to ground, connect and
    compare things. Provenance trails whose steps can be retraced,
    citing important landmarks along the path to meaningful
    conclusions. A map can be a graph, but a map fundamentally serve a
    purpose of navigation; it makes the impossible possible. It gives
    us a novel view of a landscape which may otherwise be too complex
    for us to conceptualize.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><a name="world">World</a></strong> - I believe in
    universal access to academic information as a human right.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><a name="knowledge">Knowledge</a></strong> - I believe
    that knowledge are things which are methodologically rooted in
    axioms, whether this be math, science, or history. While enjoyable
    as entertainment, I don't consider religion, music, or art to be
    knowledge (outside of the aforementioned contexts of history,
    math, science, etc). I believe the greatest sources of knowledge
    are academic papers, books, and personal web pages + essays --
    especially curations which save us all hours of work or those
    which present a novel interface which affords the reader a
    "super-power" like being able to reproduce the writer's steps
    (which we may not have been smart enough to figure out ourselves).
  </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="intro">Hierarchy of Needs</a></h2>
<p>Disclaimer &amp; Concession: Like diversification strategies for
  one's financial investing, not all one's efforts are necessarily best
  placed in a single basket. This is especially true when the problems
  we aspire to solve are multidimensional and deal with people whose
  needs exist along different level. In order to be successful at one's
  life's mission, one would be wise to first carefully identify and
  consider all the other pre-requisites necessary to be in place for its
  successful adoption. What's the point, for instance, of creating a map
  of worldly knowledge if the earth is going to be hit by an asteroid
  during our life time? Or if we have tons of knowledge, but no freedom
  of speech?  Or if you have passion to do research but can't afford
  access to academic journals?
</p>

<p>The following heirarchy of 5 needs represents my current (2018-04-30) interpretation of the pre-requisites
  required to fully actualize my life goal of curating a living map of
  the world's knowledge
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The
    <a href="https://michaelkarpeles.com/curations/preventing-catastrophe">world
      and its people need to survive</a> in order to reach their fullest
    potentials; <a href="http://imperativ.es">imperativ.es
      project</a>
  </li>         
  <li>People need <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10103053640816190?comment_id=10103054365658600&reply_comment_id=10103054517319670&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D">a voice</a>, and an <a href="https://archivelab.org">open network</a> + <a href="">medium for that voice</a>, to fight for their basic needs</li>
  <li>Peoples' basic needs need to be satisfied; i.e. people need time to think and reach their fullest potentials</li>
  <li>Liberated people <a href="/intro">need to be empowered</a> with <a href="https://openlibrary.org">access to information</a> and <a href="http://openjournal.foundation">resources</a> to reach their fullest potentials; universal</li>
  <li>Liberated, empowered people need access to augmentation to exceed the limitations of their human condition, to reach fuller potentials; wikipedia, google, <a href="https://graph.global">Graph.global</a>, <a href="https://skillsera.org">Skillsera</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It's difficult (and likely not an effective strategy) trying to accomplish all of these things. Fortunately, there are many institutions tackling different pieces of the puzzle. Here's
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10102752864060220?match=Z2l2aW5n">a list of some causes I endorse</a> (both monetarily and through my
volunteer efforts) which work on the pieces necessary for actualization of my life mission.
</p>


<h2><a name="problem">Problem</a></h2>

<p>
  One of humanity's most limiting factors is the speed by which we
  access the right information. Today there exists too great a volume
  of texts for one to manually process in their lifetime. It makes it
  commonplace to miss out in discovering a text which could change our
  life, or belief system, or understanding. This problem is
  exacerbated by unpredictable variable quality of these works and
  licensing which prevents curators from consolidation.
</p>

<p>
  For me, the process of choosing a book is so daunting it's anxiety
  inducing. Reading takes a long time. There are only so many books we
  can read. And it's even more frustrating "meta-reading" (i.e. doing
  research just to figure out what you *should* be reading). It seems
  like with all the people in the world, we should have a much better
  idea about what the most important books to read are (and mechanisms
  to determine such information in a high quality way).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Example:</strong> Here's an example of the problem and the
  opportunity. There are
  approximately <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_n_0?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A283155%2Cn%3A13905%2Ck%3Acalculus&keywords=calculus">29,681</a>
  books on Calculus on Amazon.com. How much of their content overlaps?
  How many of these books has an author read before they decide to
  write a new book on the topic?  Which books contain the best or
  unique explanations? How can all these books be connected in a way
  which allows us to seamlessly switch from one to another, when one
  particular work isn't sufficient for our use case? For more thoughts
  on this topic, refer to,
  "<a href="https://michaelkarpeles.com/essays/universal-knowledge/on-books">On
  Books</a>"
  and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10102637092696960?comment_id=10102637103979350&reply_comment_id=10102637594511320">a
  deeper survey</a> of the logistics of the problem.
  
</p>

    Pictured below: Yasiv.com is an interface which attempts to
    simplify the problem of information overload on Amazon.com by

<p>
  I believe we as a society have need for cartographers of knowledge;
  that structured, linked data, paired with domain expertise
  (e.g. wikipedia) and augmented with programatic intelligence and
  access, can help humanity and machines work together to identify and
  <a href="#map">map</a>* [shortest] paths through knowledge spaces. Each of these
  directed path(s) represent a digital curriculum. And each of these
  curriculum could be interconnected into a living, universal map of
  the world's knowledge.  The inner contents of books, academic
  papers, youtube videos could be inserted (where appropriate) into
  this graph, enabling learners to seamlessly access the right
  resources (without the friction of having to check them out at a
  library) as they navigate each step of a curricula. These will be
  the books of the 22nd century, and we have barely begun to scratch
  the surface of creating its printing press or "amazon.com".
</p>

<p><strong>*</strong> When I say <a name="map">map</a>, instead of
meaning a "mapping" (in the mathematical sense, of one thing mapping
to another) I instead literally mean a navigational map (e.g. a
mercator map), which an early explorer painstakingly labored
over. It's important to be able to calculate distance between objects
on such maps, to identify obstructions along routes (like traffic or
mountains), and to qualify which areas are unexplored.</p>

<p>A Universal Knowledge Map...</p>
<ol>
  <li>Evolves: Is constantly evolving and perpetually incomplete.</li>
  <li>Aggregates: Serves as a hub or entity-resolved index, referencing existing efforts</li>
  <li>Is Axiomatic: Resolves entities down to their simplest parts (or describes infinitely small parts via forumae)</li>
  <li>Cardinality: Has a well defined coordinate system with next and previous operations</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="what">What?</a></h2>

<p>What does a solution look like?</p>

<p>
  Imagine having a <a href="http://math.mx">digital atlas of all of
  Mathematics</a>. With the ability to see a heatmap of all the topics
  you understand, and the degree to which you understand them.  Your
  personal GPS showing you where you are; your current state of
  knowledge, what you know, and what you don't know.  Using your
  trackpad, you'd zoom semantically deeper into any subject area, just
  like google maps, learning more about the academic topology of each
  space... That combinatorics is a subfield of number theory, albeit a
  small one compared to number theory.
</p>
<p>
  Now imagine zooming in through subject areas until encountering an
  unfamiliar equation or concept, and with the press of a key, your Map
  generates a direct, shortest path
  of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10102444197400680">self-contained</a>
  directions, catered to you (based
  on <a href="http://intuitionanalytics.com/other/knowledgeDatabase/">information
  about your prior knowledge</a>;
  e.g. <a href="https://metacademy.org">Metacademy</a>, <a href="khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>
  and <a href="https://arbital.com">Arbital</a>) on how to arrive at a
  undertanding of the principle.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of getting map directions tailored to whether you are
  traveling by bike, walking, or public transit, you might choose to
  request directions for a brief walkthrough, a comprehensive example,
  or perhaps a basic overview is sufficient to address your use
  case. Now, instead of being limited to mathematics, imagine a
  Universal Knowledge Map (think of an atlas), which covers all
  scholarly knowledge and is constantly updated by the community and
  by algorithms, like Wikipedia.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine if instead of holding a single book, you could use such a
  system to simultaneously navigate all books. At an instant you could
  discern <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10102415804345590">which
  books had the best explanations</a>, which sections others read, how
  and when readers jump from book to book, and in what sequence. It
  might look something
  like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10102441523119960">this</a>.
  And what about the same thing
  for <a href="http://dissertate.org">academic papers</a>? What if
  instead of reading a paper, you could follow
  a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10102444197400680">self-contained</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTkXg2LZIMQ">literate</a>,
  expert curated curriculum which incorporates all dependencies you'd
  need to understand that work?
</p>

<p>
  Such a platform would afford researchers of any skill level to
  holistically explore any field without wasting time guessing which
  information is accessible to them and in which order they should
  read. With a living map of the world's knowledge, anyone may
  visualize and inspect their hypotheses against any and all available
  relevant information; to determine its applicability, its
  consistency and correctness, and its potential impact. And if this
  is achievable, why should we settle for anything less?
</p>

<div id="example-roam">
  <p>Here, Conor White-Sullivan talks about the problem with the current
    web, with how information is organize, and how people collaborate, and
    describes how it should be done:</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="why">Why?</a></h2>
<p>
  Out of every problem in the world, why is this one worth dedicating
  one's life? I began with a list of <strong>first principles</strong>;
  criteria which I value:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>It's Forever*: a universally relevant, never-ending goal</li>
  <li>It's Compounding*: The more it's used and advanced, the more valuable it becomes.</li>
  <li>It's Universal / Ubiquitous: Instead of serving a few people, it creates opportunity and value for everyone.</li>
  <li>It's Transparent: It forces us to recognize and address inconsistencies in our reasoning and logic.</li>
  <li>It's Impactful: Millions of hours are wasted on trying to organize information</li>
  <li>It's Scalable: It can be scaled through technology and programatic interfaces.</li>
  <li>It's Open &amp; Causa Scientiae: The mission is noble and serves the public's interest,</li>
  <li>It's Imperative: It allows us to analyze questions whose answers are critical to insuring the survival of the human race</li>
</ol>

<p>
  *I like the idea of working on problems which are universal (will
  remain relevant and compound in interest over the course of 10,000
  years). In my mind, this broadly includes mathematics and computer
  science, physics, chemistry, and biology.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Why specifically?</strong> I have
  an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10102408017839810">essay</a>
  on facebook which describes the provenance of my coming to champion
  this mission. The simplest reason I can give is Universal
  (programmatic) Access to Knowledge is <strong>just</strong>. It
  leads us towards a world I would like to
  see. It's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10102415804345590">frustrating<a>
  knowing all around the world people are duplicating the same
  inefficient preperatory steps organizing their research process and
  environment when none of it is material to the learning
  process. It's analogous to the frustration of searching for a book
  using a library card catalog versus typing in a url and retrieving a
  book instantly.  We can do better. Let's find a way to allow more
  humans to spend their time productively. My hypothesis is the result
  will be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A greater quantity of efforts addressing the world's hard problems</li>
  <li>A greater quality of mechanisms for analyzing, absorbing & deriving learnings</li>
  <li>Greater accountability and error / fact checking</li>
  <li>A reduction in non-selective ignorance</li>
  <li>A reduction of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10102426245960510">redundant</a> efforts</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Why wouldn't we want the option to consider all available and
  relevant information when attempting to explain a phenomenon? It
  allows us to [leverage technology to] reason about things outside of
  our limited scope of knowledge. I asked <cite><a href="">Jessy
  Exum</a></cite>, <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Dr. Richard Hamming</a></cite>'s million dollar question,
  "What is the most important problem in the
  universe?".<cite><a href="">Jessy Exum</a></cite> answered, "I don't
  think that any single person can know the answer to
  that"</a></cite>. I think this is one of the most compelling reasons
  that we should explore ways of sharing and uniting our
  knowledge. Because the answer to this question is imperative to the
  survival of the human race.
</p>

<p>Here are some key principles this mission addresses:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reduce redundancy: Focus on curating and organizing content to help researchers more easily discover what exists.</li>
  <li>Unsilo: Develop collaborative environments to help researchers amplify their efforts.</li>
  <li>Reproducibility: Help researchers accurately reproduce and interface with scientific results.</li>
  <li>Reduce Misinformation: Improve the accuracy of discourse and reduce inconsistency and fallacy through real-time fact-checking.</li>
  <li>Encourage Discovery: Improve the depth of discourse via real-time augmentation.</li>
  <li>Collaboration: To curate resources together and to share paths through knowledge.</li>
  <li>Provenance: Retain an epistemological history of knowledge discovery (and methods)</li>
  <li>Persistence: Eliminate single points of failure</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="how">How?</a></h2>
<p>How do we do it? What is entailed in curating a living map of the world's knowledge?
<ol>
  <li>
    Cultivate communities, protocols, and infrastructure to produce many central hubs and
    repositories of useful information, like Wikipedia, Github,
    StackExchange, Reddit, Quora, Facebook, et al.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exploring mechanisms and standards --
    like <a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF</a> (for
    images), <a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> (for chat),
    and <a href="https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">OAI-PMH</a>
    (for scholarly papers), to unite these disparate knowledge sources
    and to make their formats exchangable and interoperable, and
    consumable by both humans and computers.
  </li>    
  <li>
    Creating pipelines which use these standards to
    harvest data from these disparate sources, producing a single
    coherent, universal, distributed collection of knowledge.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recursively decomposing this well formed data into more granular semantic
    units, such as RDF entity tags (as defined by Schema.org, and
    others). Well defined, inter-compatible, common denominator units of
    information (like definitions are to a dictionary).
  </li>
  <li>
    Designing algorithms capable of recursively decomposing
    the complex documents and data representations which we've
    deferred, such as academic papers and books, into these structured
    epistemological modules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Connecting these common units of information in useful
    ways. Dissolving arbitrary document boundaries and leveraging
    communities and algorithms to thoughtfully model arbitrary
    sequences of knowledge modules and refine the relationships and
    dependencies between, them over time (e.g. Freebase and Wikidata)
  </li>
  <li>
    Once we have these curated and normalized entity graphs, this
    means creating frameworks, protocols, and interfaces which enable
    the world to effectively navigate paths through acquiring
    knowledge as seamlessly as google maps.
  </li>
  <li>
    Leveraging analytic feedback loops and tests to evolve better
    nomenclature, explanations, and sequences over time.
  </li>
  <li>
    And to ensure long-term universal, unrestricted access of this
    knowledge ecosystem for the greatest number of beneficiaries, this
    means obviating any one party's ability to control the flow of
    information by developing + adopting decentralized information
    infrastructure
    to <a href="http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web-2/">lock
    it open</a>.
  </li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="applications">Applications</a></h2>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>This necessitates†:</p>

  <li>humanity and its home must survive
    (fight disease, global warming, near-earth objects, etc)
  </li>
  
  <li>humanity's basic needs and freedoms must be met
    (shelter, food, clean water, access to information, human rights)
  </li>

  <li>our achievements must survive; we must build persistent ways for
    knowledge to be saved into perpetuity / for posterity.  (long now,
    wikimedia, internet archive)
  </li>

  <li>we must have a way to educate and support researchers and developers.
    (academies, teachers, libraries, opportunities, space)
  </li>

  <li>we must build meta-tools which facilitate aggregation and application of knowledge
    (e.g. wikipedia, google search, metacademy, arbital)
  </li>

  <li>we must responsibly augment the human condition to remain competitive and surmount limitations
    (brain-computer interfaces, VR, siri-like NLP applications, deep learning)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>Find 100 people with 100 year goals around ever-green topics (math, sciences, philosophy, medicine, history, human survival). Build prototypes which connect knowledge via graphs and unite their backends over the same database (graph.global)</p>


<h2><a name="achievable">Achievable?</a></h2>
<p>
  Many citizens of the world (Vannevar Bush, Paul Otelet, Ted Nelson,
  Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead, Jimmy Wales, Euclid,
  Brewster Kahle, Larry Page & Sergey Brin, Salman Khan, and
  countless others) dedicated vast amounts of their life energy to
  improving accessibility of information. Some were so focused in
  their mission they became tunnel-visioned (e.g. the Principica
  Mathematica's violation of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem) and
  didn't spend sufficient time asking important questions as to the
  viability and consequences of their approaches.
</p>

<p>
  Often when I tell people my goal, they classify me as a dreamer.
  And while I may be deserving of their cynicism, I'd like to think I
  make an active effort to
<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11340-all-men-dream-but-not-equally-those-who-dream-by">dream
  with my eyes open</a>. I readily concede my goals are more ambitious
  than I as an individual can expect to accomplish within my
  lifetime. But instead of sacrificing the scope of my goal, I instead
  aspire to make steady progress on manageable, solvable, and high
  impact sub-problems, to reach milestones of progress often, and for
  that which I can accomplish, do so well and with a clear trail
  of provenance that others may leverage after I am gone.
</p>

<p>
  Towards this goal, I
  use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k-zl-Ya4OAU7Lp8DsPGy7mSJVCeXSPqK673Wiq8ndt8/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheets
  to quantify my progress</a> and actively surround myself with
  comrades who can give me constructive criticisms and who can guide me

  my enthusiasm</a>. I observe a similar philosophy as my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10101469875838900">mentor</a> <cite><a href="">Aaron Swartz</a></cite> in his essay,
  "<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity">Productivity</a>" (see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10102401895439150">my addition thoughts</a>). 
  I try to stand on the shoulders of giants and learn from their
  successes, as well as their mistakes. Some of my favorite lessons
  I've preserved <a href="https://michaelkarpeles.com/curations/life-lessons#sec-1">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Many of these lessons have made me sensitive to many challenges and
  logistic limitations which may prevent me from realizing some
  elements of this mission
  (i.e. <a href="http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm"><cite>Cory
  Doctrow's</cite>, "Metacrap: Putting the torch to seven straw-men of
  the
  meta-utopia"</a>, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frame-problem/"><cite>John
  McCarthy</cite>'s, "Frame
  Problem"</a>, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/"><cite>Kurt
  Gödel</cite>'s, "Incompleteness Theorem"</a>). And while I try to be
  considerate and ground myself by these cautionary principles, I
  nonetheless subscribe to the philosophy that
  the, <a href="https://michaelkarpeles.com/essays/philosophy/incompleteness-theorem">Incompleteness
  Theorem Doesn't Mean "Stop Trying"</a> -- It just means,
  thoughtfully "Scope Your Objectives".
</p>

<p>
  I think it's achievable to get to the point where human computation
  and (in the same vein) communication are the limiting factor to what
  we can learn, and not information retrieval and latency. That is, we
  will be able to instantly retrieve an answer to any question we can
  imagine, and the process by which we imagine and form questions will
  become our bottleneck. I believe this fundamental limitation of the
  human condition (which impacts how we think and communicate) will be
  addressed by extending out humanity with technology at a more
  intimate level (i.e. bci and more "direct" access).
</p>

<p>
  Is this achievable in my life time? Probably not, which is why part
  of my life needs to be dedicated to the sustainability of the world,
  discovering the right people who are capable of making forward
  progress on these issues, cultivating the interest of others and
  explaining why these problems are so important, and documenting my
  learnings and ideas as carefully as I can.

</ul>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  Perhaps you have a similar goal and would like to know what other
  work has been done towards its success. My path is informed by many
  great mathematicians, philosophers, scientists, and archivists who
  have been informing efforts for decades:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><cite w2gid="">Alfred Whitehead</cite>
  and <cite w2gid="">Bertrand Russell</cite> authored
  the <cite>Principia Mathematica</cite> which was an important
  experiment and step in formalizing all of math. Except, their
  specific approach was doomed from conception. Similar to the roles
  of <cite>Marvin Minsky</cite> and <cite>Roger Schank</cite> in
  catalyzing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI
