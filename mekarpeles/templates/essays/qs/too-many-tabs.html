<h1>PROBLEM: I have too many browser tabs open! [SOLVED]</h1>
<h2>Let's apply the 5 Why's</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Why do I have too many browser tabs?</h3>
    <p>Because I want to keep them spatially and temporally local; they are relevant to what I am doing and/or my current interests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Why do I want to keep them open? Why not just read them?</h3>
    <p>
      Because I don't have time to read them now and I figure keeping
      them open will lead to a higher likely-hood of them being
      read. Consider: When does misuse of "cache" effectively become
      RAM, become the same as disk storage/access, etc.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Surely if I don't have time to read them now, that would mean I must have time to read them later, right? After all, I have time to consume some media (Q.E.D - as is being demonstrated). Why don't the tabs get consumed and then garbage collected?</h3>
    <p>
      Because I don't want to say no, because I don't have a framework
      for evaluating media holistically against each other. Because
      there's no friction preventing, or significant consequences to,
      opening of new tabs. Because I as a human being cannot keep a
      model in my head for sometimes hundreds of pieces of content,
      their importance, their topics, or the date they were discovered
      -- and thus cannot effectively make decisions on how to address
      the overwhelming tab monster.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Would a centralized system with slightly more friction, structure, and inter-contextual relevance help? Why not bookmarks?</h3>
    <p>Yeah, probably. What are you playing at ... ?</p>
    <p>
      Bookmarks are a black hole. They simply offers a slightly
      greater promise (and a smaller, albeit still unmaintainable
      search space) of finding a resource again than searching the web
      directly. Most context (other than page title and an optional
      category) is lost. For instance, there is semantic value encoded
      in having multiple tabs open -- their mutual existence can add
      value to the equation, as a reference. For instance, imagine
      translating a Chinese document and having a "dictionary" tab, a
      "stroke-order" tab, a "pronunciation" tab (not all resources are
      best at all 3 tasks). A bookmark does not sufficiently encode
      these relationships or their co-related value.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Why isn't there something better than bookmarks? What would it look like and why haven't you tried this?</h3>
    <p>
      Because browsers are victorious by competing on standards and
      performance, foremost, and providing the best experience to the
      most users. Some features (like a directed graph of your entire
      browser history) may require fundamental changes to the browser's
      internals and negatively affect performance. It's unfortunate,
      because browsers impact a lot of people, but (disregarding the
      audience multiplier and assuming building-for-self), designing
      browser features has a low return compared to the time investment
      and the programmer has to address tangential concerns. It's like
      disassembling a car to install a new engine, and running
      diagnostics on all the other components to ensure there's no oil
      leak, versus installing NOS (yeah, it can leak, there are
      occasional fires, and sometimes catastrophes, but ZOOM
      ZOOM!). Besides, NOS allows you to more quickly achieve and
      compare speed (analogy: approaches) and get a feel before having
      to choose an engine design. So, this is why I'm not starting with
      the browser (although I do have a side project for prototyping
      these ideas within an unperformant webpage, rather than through
      the browser, proper). That said, the correct minimal solution
      shouldn't depend on an architecture (will only be enhanced by it),
      so we should be able to prototype it elsewhere (in a less-friction
      environment, lower development-cost environment).
    </p>
    <p>
      Minimally, it would look like a simple, centralized google
      spreadsheet with a list of links, their titles, a rating, and the
      date completed. I would thus sort them according to my
      interest. If manually adding a link + desc to the list is too much
      friction, the resource likely isn't work it.

    <h3><underline>Here's a bonus question:</underline> Why read
    everything on your queue? Is all of it good? Now that you are
    testing a legitimate system for queuing up media. How can you
    improve this?</h3>
    <p>
      Chances are I don't want to read everything on my list. By
      making the document public + shared and asking others I respect
      what media on my list I should skip, or by asking for
      recommendations for alternative, superior resources on the same
      topic, I can achieve a superior outcome.

<h2>Tab Groups</h2>
<p>
  Mozilla Firefox
  has <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tab-groups-organize-tabs">tab
    groups</a> which I utilize (despite their implementation being
  graphical and frustrating).
</p>

<p>I use tab groups as workspaces to manage collections of tabs that I actually do need open.</p>

<h3>Collections</h3>
<p>I have 3 sets of tab groups --</p>
<ul>
  <li>For Learning: (Chinese, AI/ML, Math, Music)</li>
  <li>For Projects: one for each project on my plate (math.mx, pypc, bestbookon, etc)</li>
  <li>For Living: for my blog + meta-organization + work</li>
</ul>

<div>
  <p>Image 1: a screen capture of the above tabgroup collections</p>
  <img alt="tagroups screenshot" src="/static/imgs/tabgroups.jpg"/>
</div>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>I do not have more than 10 tabs open in a workspace.</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>
  I use <entity>stumpwm</entity> a tiling window manager. The
  following image illustrates why I dislike Mozilla's graphical
  implementation of tab-groups and wish that tab-groups were just a
  second tier of tabs (tabs containing tabs). The following result
  occurs every time my window manager gets split (horizontally or
  vertically):

<h2>Pinning</h2>
<p>Finally, I have one instance of chrome open where I have the following applications always pinned:</p>
<ol>
  <li>calendar</li>
  <li>quantified self spreadsheet</li>
  <li>trello daily goals</li>
  <li>gmail work</li>
  <li>gmail personal</li>
  <li>and unpinned, occasionally facebook</li>
</ol>
