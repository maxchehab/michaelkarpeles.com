we tell lies because we are gambling that people won't validate our
statements because the process is too disruptive and full of friction.


We lie for the same reason we break any law. Because we think it serves our own interest and the benefit outweighs our risk profile for getting caught.



Without (at least a protocol which affords us) a central point of
truth which people can easily query, we're bound to repeat many of
each other's efforts.
