<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  Over the last three years, we've seen a lot of movement around what
  people are referring to as the "Decentralized" or "Distributed" Web.
  It's often accompanied by words like "blockchain", "cryptocurrency",
  "content-addressability", "P2P" (peer-to-peer), "torrents", "mesh", and
  protocols/implementations
  like <a href="https://ipfs.io/">ipfs</a>, <a href="https://datproject.org">dat</a>, <a href="https://ssbc.github.io/secure-scuttlebutt/">secure
  scuttlebutt</a>, <a href="https://gun.eco/#step1">gun</a>,
  and <a href="https://solid.mit.edu">solid</a>. What's the deal?
</p>

<p>
  In the 1960's, 20 years before the Internet even existed, Ted Nelson
  was presciently describing a system called Xanadu which featured
  unbreakable bi-directional hypertext links, version controlled
  documents which supported incremental publishing, and side-by-side
  document comparison. By 1991, when Tim Berners-Lee invented the
  World Wide Web, only a subset of his and Ted's ideas made it
  mainstream. Now, after 25+ years of learnings, its become clear we
  didn't get everything perfectly the first time around. Some of these
  compromises and shorcomings were imposed on us through limitations
  in technology. Advancements in cryptography, computer networks, web
  standards, and computing power have since unlocked possibilities
  which were out of reach the first time around.

<p>
  Hindsight is twenty-twenty. The "Decentralized Web" is an effort to
  redesign elements of the World Wide Web which revealed themselves to
  be imperfect and to integrate concepts which were previously too
  expensive or complex to operate efficiently at scale. For instance,
  much of the web isn't backed up anywhere and there's only a single
  copy. If this copy disappears, its lost for good. Also, web sites
  change over time, often clobbering their previous versions because
  the web doesn't have version control. Tons of content on the web is
  duplicated in inefficient ways. The current web user is at the mercy
  of ISPs to route them to content, which means it would be easy for
  an ISP to censor information they rely on. The web isn't currently
  designed for offline access. While we have protocols like bittorrent
  which allows users to share the load of transfering files, the web
  wasn't built to work this way.
</p>

<p>
  But as is any topic of digital warfare, the drive for a
  Decentralized Web is not all sunshine and roses.

<h2>What is the World Wide Web?</h2>
<p>
  We should probably start with one of the most common conflations:
that between the Internet and the Web (because for many, these two
technologies are effectively synonymous).
</p>

<p>
  In 1961-1965 computer users were less concerned with sending
  messages between computers and more concerned with communicating
  with the other handful of users who were time-sharing multiplexed central mainframes
  with them. To communicate with each
  other, <a href="http://multicians.org/thvv/mail-history.html">they
  would create files with names like "TO TOM" and place them in public
  folders</a>. <a href="http://multicians.org/multicians.html#MorrisNI">Noel
  Morris</a>
  and <a href="http://multicians.org/thvv/mail-history.html">Tom Van
  Vleck</a> ran with the idea to create the MAIL program, which MIT
  supported because they needed away to alert people when their
  processes had finished running. Mail will become an important use
  case later in this story.
</p>

<p>
  The early Internet began circa 1969 with
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>
  network, a project funded by the US Department of Defense. One of
  project's first victories was a packet switching node called the
  Interface Message Processor (IMP) which enabled participants to
  interconnect within the ARPANET network. Fun fact, IMP was the topic
  of the first RFC-1 by Steve Crocker. In June 1970, RFC 54 was
  published detailing a new protocol called the Network Control
  Program which allowed two computers to connect on 2 seperate ports
  (a dedicated channel for each machine to receive and send,
  respectively). In 1971, Abhay Bhushan built the File Transfer
  Protocol (FTP) on top of NCP and made it possible and easy for
  computers to implement and participate in file sharing. Shortly
  after in
  1972, <a href="http://history-computer.com/Internet/Maturing/Tomlinson.html">Ray
  Tomlinson</a> combined his bespoke CPYNET file transfer program
  (which <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc310">Bhushan
  discusses in RFC 310</a>) with SNDMSG to send the first email. By
  ~1976, email accounted for 75% of all ARPANET traffic and the idea
  of networked computers was catching on.
</p>

<p>
<quote>
  "Our experience with ad hoc techniques of data and file transfer over
  the ARPANET together with a better knowledge of terminal IMP (TIP)
  capabilities and Datacomputer requirements has indicated to us that
  the Data Transfer Protocol (DTP) [...] and the File Transfer
  Protocol (FTP) [...] could undergo revision.  Our effort in
  implementing DTP and FTP has revealed areas in which the protocols
  could be simplified without degrading their usefulness."
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc310">(source)</a>

<p>
  The Internet as we know it today took shape in 1983 when Robert Kahn
  and Vint Cerf, ARPANET engineers, co-invented the TCP/IP stack which
  deprecated NCP and provided a new generalized a common interface for
  multiple computers to address, connect, and transmit information to
  each other. One key advantage is it only required binding to one
  duplex port (for sending and receiving), whereas NCP bound to two
  simplex ports. The IP part of TCP/IP allows each computer to have
  its own uniquely identifying Internet (Protocol) Address (similar to
  a street address). Any machines with IP addresses could follow the
  format of TCP to request and establish a connection with others.
  When you are downloading a linux distribution using bittorrent, you
  are using the Internet and taking advantage of the TCP/IP stack but
  you are not using the web (unless you found the torrent magnet link
  via a website). IRC protocol and AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)'s TOC2
  would have been two other examples of services which required
  Internet access and TCP/IP connections but operated independently of
  the web.

<p> By the late 80s, the groundwork -- i.e. many of the protocols we
  still use today -- was in place, but the Internet was being used in
  one of two ways. First, computers were connecting directly to each
  other to transfer files from the command line and second, groups
  were creating an array of bespoke protocols on top of TCP/IP to
  enable specific uses cases like mail and chat (IRC). So what was
  missing?
</p>

<p>
  For one, in the spirit of mailing, there wasn't a good way to make
  your messages public to everyone. Sharing was really hard. Tim
  Berners-Lee envisioned an ecosystem which enabled, "automatic
  information-sharing between scientists in universities and
  institutes". With FTP you were very limited in what you could show
  other users -- they could essentially only download or upload raw
  files, not seamlessly navigate documents.
</p>

<p>
  The web was conceived in much the same way as mail was at
  MIT. <a href="http://www.nethistory.info/History%20of%20the%20Internet/web.html">Ted
  Nelson originally demo'd hyperlinks as a way for jumping and
  navigating documents</a> locally in his Xanadu system, even though
  his bigger picture was to allow hyperlinking across computers.
</p>

<p>In December 1990, Tim Berners-Lee created a new type of service
  which would make the idea of the web mainstream by releasing the
  first HTTP
  server: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=CERN_httpd&oldid=841562980">CERN
  httpd</a>. The idea was, anyone in the world could install an HTTP
  server on their computer and, so long as the server was running, it
  would become part of a global network of documents which could be
  accessed by a new type of address called a URL. Shortly after in
  1993, special document viewers called web browsers were born which
  were able to any person's published documents who was running and
  http server. This was only possible because many people were running
  the same software and all the machines were speaking a common
  language which these web browsers were programmed to speak.
</p>

<h2>Evolution of the Web</h2>
<p>
  This isn't the first time the Web has sought to evolve. We've seen an
  important drive every 7 or so years. In 1999 there was an effort
  labeled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web2.0 "The
  Participative / Social Web"</a> which was a drive to make the Web
  more social and to empower participation. During this period,
  websites started to become much more dynamic with the use of
  javascript. Social networks emerged where conversations and
  commenting became mainstream online.
</p>

<p>
  In 2006, we launched
  into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web#Web_3.0">Web3.0
  "The Semantic Web"</a>, an effort which urged website creators to
  enrich/annotate their website content with additional semantic
  metadata to make it more searchable and discoverable. The inclusion
  of this metadata is part of what allows google and other search
  engines to show smart results when you type in a query like, "best
  movies in 2018".
</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="/static/imgs/google-now.png">
  <p>A search for "best movies for 2018" in google returns smart,
  zero-click, Google Now results powered by their knowledge graph</p>
</div>

<p>
  Between 2011 and now we've seen a variety of important technologies
  emerge. Javascript build systems and transpilers, React and Angular,
  single-page-webapps, progressive web apps, polyfills and web
  components, flex &amp; grid. But more than anything, what we've seen
  is concentration of power. Google acquired youtube in 2006. Verizon
  acquired Yahoo and AOL. Facebook owns instagram and
  whatsapp. Microsoft now owns linkedin, yammer, github, and skype and
  also has a 11.5% stake in Comcast and 3% of AT&amp;T. During this
  period <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websites_blocked_in_mainland_China">google,
  facebook, youtube, twitter, instagram, pinterest, nytimes,
  soundcloud, dropbox, archive.org have all experienced blockages from
  China</a>. In 2017, the United States Federal Communications
  Commission (FCC) passed a vote
  on <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/17-108.html">Docket
  17-108</a> to roll back the Open Internet Order of 2015 which makes
  it so US Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can offer preferencial
  treatment (e.g. fast-lines) to the competing web services they own
  and manage. And the web has become rampant with companies who use
  supercomputers to play
  "<a href="http://fortune.com/2018/03/20/tech-humane-tristan-harris/">chess
  with your mind</a>" and inundate our attention with
  advertisements. In one sentence, the world wide web is starting to
  look a lot like cable tv and engineers and activists alike are
  beginning to look towards changes which may require a fundamental
  paradigm shift in how the web works.

<h2>Healthy Reservations about Decentralization</h2>
<p>In a few important ways, I’m a cynic of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jackson.kernion/posts/10156426135140132?comment_id=10156427374760132&reply_comment_id=10156427417855132&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R5%22%7D">decentralization</a> and <a href="https://michaelkarpeles.com/essays/politics/software-protocols-are-modern-warfare">technology as a silver bullet</a>. And I think this is a healthy perspective because we’re still in the early days. That doesn’t mean I don’t think it will succeed, or that it shouldn’t succeed. Only that I see efforts like cryptocurrency as the rollercoasters they are — there’s billions of dollars out there and plenty of incentive for capitalists to collude to game the system, numerous ways governments can impose unsavory regulations, security vulnerabilities which have yet to be discovered, and issues around scaling and efficiency which still need to be revealed and addressed. And when these efforts go wrong, or groups which are highly organized and funded step in to undermine a new effort, it can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jackson.kernion/posts/10156426135140132?comment_id=10156427320445132&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R2%22%7D">cause a lot of damage</a>.
</p>

<p>
I think we're still missing an critical component to adoption, defensibility, and sustainability, and that's education. Many of these systems are being designed in myopic bubbles and are rapidly being presented to people who don't understand the consequences of the technology. My personal philosophy is to not invest in things I don’t understand well, and not to invest more than I can afford to lose and I feel like perhaps too many people are shooting for the moon with bitcoin and other coins. And maybe they’ll win the bet, but it’s strange to think major financial infrastructure is being built over top of these bets. Without education, there's also the issue of hype. Investory dump money into anything with the name blockchain, AI, or crypto-currency because their top priority is investing in a technology which has the potential to spread massively, like a virus. And I think this type of strategy undermines a lot of legitimate efforts and risks creating things which are indeed a lot like viruses.</p>

<p>I don’t want to be too cynical — hopefully just the right amount of cynical. And right now I think we’re still in a proving and experimenting phase, of what stands to be a really important transition for the world, if done right.</p>

<p>Can I share a short story?</p>

<h3>Stripe</h3>

<p>I remember when John Collison first showed me Stripe.com at the Noisebridge hackerspace in San Francisco.</p>

<p>He was able initiate a payment on my credit card using an http curl. I think this woke me up to the idea that in an ideal world, payments could be done instantly using APIs and maybe didn’t require huge amount of middleware. I also so how much fraud Stripe had to deal with, and PayPal as well — that’s a huge part of the value they add. And so I get the feeling special protocols, or otherwise centralized trust institutions, will still be necessary in the future of the decentralized web.</p>

<p>In short, there will always be risks, and we would do well to <a href="https://michaelkarpeles.com/essays/philosophy/curbing-your-enthusiasm">Curb our Enthusiasm</a>. But we should also <a href="https://michaelkarpeles.com/essays/philosophy/incompleteness-theorem#dweb">keep trying</a>.

<h2>Centralization, Decentralization & Re-Centralization- Breaking the Cycle</h2>
<p>
This title was retroactively taken from <a href="https://decentralizedwebsummit2018.sched.com/event/FfPC/roundtable-centralization-decentralization-re-centralization-breaking-the-cycle">Cory Doctrow</a>'s Decentralized Web Summit 2018 round table.</p>

<p>
A strange thing about the web is, in many ways it's always been a decentralized system.
Organizations like Google and Facebook have actually had a heck of a time centralizing it.
</p>

<pre>
We have 3B+ people[1] with internet access, each with their own brain,
each thinking of ideas separately, taking notes separately, sometimes
even across several different programs (google docs, evernote,
etherpad, github, facebook, email). You likely have thought before,
"Shoot, I've stumbled across some excellent resources on the web which
are buried" or "I can't believe this idea was discovered 20 years
ago". The fact is, the web (and pretty much no system) is not set up
to be centralized (for instance, there's no single source of trust for
authentication/identity, no single source of all academic papers in
the world, and no entity resolution or algorithm to perfectly maintain
a record/index of all the services even which try to address these
centralization efforts!)

Don't get me wrong, decentralization has many favorable qualities. It
can offer a strategy for a degree fault tolerance and permanence,
discourage monopolization, and can provide efficient dispatch,
computation, and retrieval of (especially too large for an individual
commodity machine) tasks/data which are well suited for parallel
computation or which can benefit from spatial and or temporal
locality.

But the most important element of decentralization is that it
decentralizes something meant to be centralized (by definition). And
this requires, by necessity of definition, that we indeed have a
solution for how centralization is achieved. And if you ask me, we're
not especially good at this. Again, the Economy, politics/voting,
authentication as examples.

Why is it imperative to address this today? Because, we're creating
more and more data, but our mechanisms for improving the web (as a
protocol) are not keeping up. Right now, Google (and several other
"indexing search engines") are retroactively turning a distributed
system into a centralized one by running imperfect algorithms over all
documents in the web. This is partly an issue of trust -- Google et
al. do this because people are afraid that there should be any single
institution physically capable of monopolizing an index of the web (I
say physically as opposed to practically as Google eta al. do
practically control this -- just not to the mutual exclusion of any
other party).

Thus, today there is no perfect ledger of all existing documents
(other than these artificially produced, imperfect ones). The obvious
solution (which is not so obvious to implement and get adopted) is
building "decentralized" centralization into the protocol-level
itself. That is, for decentralized agents (necessitated by the
logistic enormity of the task) to maintain a centralized ledger, at a
protocol level. IPFS (https://ipfs.io) is one interesting attempt to
achieve this. Bitcoin and Ethereum are interesting approaches as well,
which not only replace a middleware, but also provide a more
comprehensive real-time solution.

The question remains, even with a framework of decentralization to
power a the centralized solution we need, how do we incentive
innovation of this framework (e.g. Filecoin; http://filecoin.io/) and
what might a decentralized-centralized web look like or enable us to
accomplish?  Imagine if there was a single note taking database for
the whole world. And as you type a note, the service compares and
entity resolves (matches) your note against every other note in this
universal database. You see an auto-complete dropdown box, just like
when you're tagging someone in facebook, and it allows you to link
your idea or add your ideas to an existing record. Instead of Google
trying to reverse engineer search engine result pages, we'd have a
real web of knowledge. All original ideas and notes would exist only
once, people would spend less time seeing what's been done, and
spending more time adding value to the universal graph.

Of course a lot has to happen (and other infrastructure is required)
before this vision becomes a reality, but it's achievable in our life
time. A real universalized, decentralized-centralized framework /
index, not owned by any one person; a single stream of consciousness
of all worldly knowledge, accessible to all.

P.S. I am attempting to build something like this (but only for my
blog) to allow me to register ideas, notes, todo items in a universal
database. I will be the first to gladly admit Mark Carranza has had
this built[2] and has been using it for himself for *years*, and only
today did I really understand its full potential (though I know there
are things he wishes it had, like better semantic tagging, todo
functionality, and an API into other service -- some of which he may
have added since we last spoke) which will be fun to work on.
