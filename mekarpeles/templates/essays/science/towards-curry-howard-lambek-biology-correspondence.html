<h1>Exploring "equivalence" of Biology and Boolean Logic</h1>

<p>
  What can we learn by attempting to implement biologies systems using
  symbolic logic, and what improvements can be made in our
  implementations of symbolic logic through the study of biology? That
  is the purpose of this exploration.
</p>

<h2>Forward</h2>
<p>
  I've been considering the dichotomy of "symbolic" systems, such as
  pure math (which exists in the theoretical domain, not subject to
  the effects of physics), and "physical" systems (which are subject
  to hidden variables and uncertainty, e.g. Heisenberg
  uncertainty). I've attempted to document these raw thoughts in the
  preface of the following essay.
</p>

<p>
  This comparison (which can be oversimplified as physics v. theory)
  and the role of "computers" as a medium for translation between
  these two domains is ancillary to the essay's main objective: to
  explore the implementations and properties of Biological computation
  (how symbolic computation emerges "naturally" from biological,
  physical systems) and Boolean Logic (Von Neumann architecture and
  how present day computers implement symbolic logic over physical
  matter).
</p>

<p>
  Ideally, this comparison will evolve over time to examine the most
  basic biological components and the most basic electronic
  implementations of boolean logic gates from both directions
  (creating boolean gates using these axiomatic biological components
  and created the axiomatic biological components using
  electronics). The outcome would be the ability to manipulate
  physical systems (using techniques and components like schmitt
  trigger triggers in electronics to enable circuits to be robust
  against the uncertainty of physics) to construct playgrounds where
  we can make promises about deduction about the equivalence of
  biology and computer programs (like the Curry-Howard correspondence,
  but including isomorphism to biological systems)
</p>


<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>
  The reason pure math "works" (i.e. has the property of being
  proveable and internally consistent) is because it is abstract and
  symbolic. That is, it exists in a theoretical domain which is not
  subject to the physics of the universe and its complex variables and
  their uncertainties over time. Within the static, unchanging context
  of the symbolic domain, we can freely test axioms and their
  consequences, control the construction and scope of a problem,
  examine properties of expressions using different approaches, and
  prove the consistency, correctness, and properties of theorems.
</p>

<p>
  While these properties of the symbolic domain convenience us to make
  deep promises about the integrity, inferences, and comparison of
  purely symbolic mathematical systems, it doesn't eliminate the
  reality that many of the systems we care about are subject to the
  chaotic laws of our physical universe. In such physical domains, we
  have less luxury of controlling our axioms. We may eliminate some
  variables by controlling our environment, even manipulate the powers
  of physics within reason of our technical capabilities
  (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RpLOKqTcSk">Bose-Einstein
  Conensate</a> or the
  world's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E43-CfukEgs">biggest
  vacuum chamber</a>), but we cannot change that the universe is made
  of quarks -- a confounding constraint pure mathematics can ignore.
</p>

<p>
  The need for symbolic systems is necessitated by the complexity of
  our physical world. It seems there is always something more we do
  not know, in which every other computation depends:

  <blockquote>
    "For centuries [people] lived in the belief that truth was slim and
    elusive and that once [it was] found [...], the troubles of [our]kind
    would be over. [One] of knowledge in our time is bowed down under a
    burden [one] never imagined [one] would ever have: The
    overproduction of truth that cannot be consumed."
    <br/> -- <cite>The Denial of Death</cite> (page xviii, paragraph 1) by <cite>Ernest Becker</cite>
  </blockquote>

  To fully understand the physical world in its entirety requires that
  it be exhaustively, deterministically computable, and fully
  observable. At the quantum level, this "unfolding of the layers of
  the onion" requires creativity and finese as objects become so small
  that even observing them changes their behaviour. Instead of hedging
  all of our bets on speculatation on whether we will someday be able
  to compute what happened before the big bang, or the exact location
  of an electron with full confidence without relying on heisenberg
  uncertainty principle, for instance, there's reason to create
  incrementally better (more accurate) tools and systems for
  approximating these answers (or function).
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately, our universe is sufficiently complex as to support
  physical systems (made of matter and subject to the laws of physics)
  capable of faithfully emulating isolatable symbolic domains at high
  (albeit finite) accuracy. A computer is one example of a
  "sub-universe" we can create whose axioms are those of symbolic
  logic, a subset of symbolic mathematics. In later sections, it will
  be explored how the ingenuity of electronic design and engineering
  has enabled computers to uphold such a promise; to achieve
  resiliance and robustness to the seemingly untamable chaos and
  stochasticism of physics. The importance of the computer is that it
  provides a medium for integrating symbolic systems into our physical
  lives; as a frictionless translation layer between the physical and
  the symbolic.
</p>

<p>
  Why is important to be able to engineer faithfully symbolic systems
  from within our physical reality? First, it affords us
  interoperability; the ability for observations to be taken directly
  from the physical word and then analyzed within a controllable,
  symbolic environment. Second, we benefit from one the standard
  features of symbolic systems, which is that they are fully
  observable; they allow us to simulate and test complex interactions
  while maintaining full control over the environment's variables and
  axioms, giving us insights into the workings of the physical
  world. Most importantly, as "implementations" of symbolic logic,
  they provide us with a extensible, evolvable framework for
  performing repeatable computation (executing algorithms).
</p>

<p>
  How much can we trust a computer proof?
  See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curryâ€“Howard_correspondence">Curry-Howard
  Correspondence</a>. Is the computer the only viable approach of
  implementing symbolic systems?
</p>

<p>
  The dichotomy of pure symbolic mathematics and the physical universe
  means that we can make progress in either domain/direction. Towards
  a perfect understanding of the physical universe, or in advancing
  discrete tools and systems for solving certain problems in
  isolation. But so too can we discuss the dichotomy of different
  systems. Boolean logic is not the only implementable system for
  computation. We also have biology, an evolutionary system which
  evolved independently and from different axioms than boolean
  logic. Because biology is a physical system and boolean logic a
  symbolic one, perhaps the same dichotomy exists as does at the
  higher level comparison of the physical universe and symbolic math
  (in their totality).
</p>

<p>
  What can we learn by attempting to implement biology's systems using
  symbolic logic, and what improvements can be made in our
  implementations of symbolic logic through the study of biology? How
  and where will the brain and the transistor "meet in the middle"?
  And can it be demonstrated that computationally they are equivalent?
  That is the purpose of this exploration.

<h2>Tangent (Essay)</h2>

(MIT virtual science laboratory) is an amazing technology and resource
for anyone interested in practicing Synthetic Biology</p>

<h3>Provenance Trail</h3>
<p>
  The past few days I've gone down a rabbit hole involving biology and
  computational theory. I became particularly interested in the
  relationship between electric circuits (physically engineered
  implementations of boolean logic) and biological systems. What might
  be, or has been, learned about their comparative computational
  abilities or properties, and how might understanding one inform
  advances within the other? While my journey has just begun, I've
  recorded breadcrumbs of my findings[1] to organize myself and others
  interested in the topic.</p>
<p>
  This whole spiral started in a very "Mark P Xu Neyerian" kind of
  way, by thinking about Curry-Howard Correspondence (Isomorphism),
  which demonstrates computational equivalence between mathematics and
  computer programs (i.e. boolean logic). I wondered if a similar
  correspondence might exist between biological systems and boolean
  logic. I admit this question is more than slightly naive (it is
  in-concrete what "equivalence" means in this context), given biology
  is built of the chemical elements and on top physics, both of which
  are subject to measurement uncertainty. If a loose correspondence
  can be demonstrated and we are able to determine both (a) mappings
  between biological systems and boolean logic, as well as (b)
  determine the chemical and thus mathematical thresholds under which
  these biological systems predictably operate equivalently (in the
  same way a Schmitt trigger is used in electronics to make electrical
  circuits robust against uncertainty and variability in electrical
  flow), this may expand the way we can use computers to cheaply and
  accurately test, evolve, or even prove biological and medical
  results.
</p>

<p>
  I also must admit, if this question of Curry-Howard-Biology
  correspondence is new, it's only because it hasn't been phrased
  "exactly" as such and because it's implications are mostly
  philosophical and don't contribute to the underlying sciences and
  experiments -- both which are anything but new and have been around
  for many years. Systems Biology, for instance, attempts to
  understand and emulate biological components, and vice versa through
  computational models[2]. The field of Biocomputing attempts to
  achieve some of the same learnings from the opposite direction, by
  creating physical boolean logic gates and other computational
  systems from biological material[3]. There is yet another field,
  Synthetic Biology, which constitutes the interaction of engineering
  practices and biology to design and synthesize biological components
  for specific applications.
</p>

<p>
  In order to connect the dots and make headway in any of these
  directions towards my goal, I needed a better understanding of what
  the simplest units of biology are. I had to consider, what is below
  the "cell"? What are the simplest biological constructs (molecules,
  systems) made only of the elements (which rise only from chemistry)?
  This question too has two directions. One, we can deduce the
  structure and components of the "cell" (from the cell down to its
  lowest level constituent parts) or two, we can inductively determine
  the arrangement of chemicals and circumstances required for
  biological, organic matter and simple biological systems to emerge
  from pure chemistry (abiogenesis/biopoiesis -- see Miller-Urey
  experiment)[4].
</p>

<p>
  Synthetic biology may be the answer to "Schmitt trigger" analogy I
  previously entertained, as a medium for controlling the uncertainty
  effects of biological variables, determine attribution/consequences
  of variables, and in retroactively verifying results. Which made me
  wonder, how does synthetic biology work? I first watched this
  video[5] which followed a team of new biology researchers in a
  project to create bacterial capable of changing color within
  parasite infested water. The video is very practical and also
  follows environment consequences and implications, design
  considerations, and the reality of experimentation (regression
  testing), and team/lab dynamics. While the video was quite
  understandable, what the video didn't outline was any sort of
  terminology for contextualizing or reproducing the different
  experimental steps. I found myself wanting to know what processes
  the scientists were running and how. That's when I saw Labster[6]
  and was sufficiently impressed by the idea. Even in the video, the
  steps of Synthetic Biological are demystified. The best part is, the
  program seems like an amazingly safe, fast, scalable and accessible
  alternative to laboratories and hazardous material.
</p>

<p>
  In the interest in time-boxing this tangent, my next step is to
  continue exploring the simplest systems within biology, as well as
  how they may be functionally emulated through boolean logic. Updates
  soon!
